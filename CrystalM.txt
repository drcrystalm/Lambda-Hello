Hello, I'm Crystal Martin.  This is my alternative reality
Adventurer  /Lazy
Mother      /Messy
Minimalist  /TV watcher

I have two kids, Scout and Sawyer, a Great Dane and a French Bulldog. I am a chiropractor by day, coding ninja by night. Last year I raised 3 litters of Frenchies, and it was the best job ever.
